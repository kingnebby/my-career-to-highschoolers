![](img/warcraft-map-editor.png)

Note:
* I was 12 yrs old
* I didn't know I was doing programming, but I just loved creating things.

+++

### Inspiration

* Uncle Steven
* Janet Ash

Note:
* At 15 yrs old I had to make a decision
* I really didn't know what I wanted to do, I just knew that I loved solving problems and was good at spending time in front of a computer

+++

### Interruptions

* Denied from UW Seattle
* Failed an entire college quarter 
* I had two bands

Note:
* My mom wouldn't let me drop out. Listen to your mommas!

+++

### A Unlikely Finish

* Graduated and proceed to... Â¡Mexico!
* Uncle Steven, again

Note:
* I was terrified of the idea of sitting behind a desk ALL day
* I went to Mexico to job-shadow a Missionary
* Decided that someone had to fund him and I was years away from that level of maturity
* Uncle Steven landed me a job just in time for me to ask Emily Watts out on a date
