### First Exposure

![](img/warcraft-map-editor.png)

Note:
* I was 12 yrs old
* I didn't know I was doing programming, but I just loved creating things.

+++

### Education at a Glance

* Home-schooled, Private Schooled, Running Start
* Graduated with a 2 year Associates of Science Degree
* Pursued a BS in Computer Science and Systems
* **Total:** 5 1/2 yrs, working 3 jobs and had 10K in debt

Note:
* 2 yr AS: I was planning to be an EE, but switched.
* 5 1/2 yrs: I doesn't normally take that long, but it will if you do smart things like fail an entire quarter.

+++

### An Unlikely Finish

* Graduated and proceed to...

Note:
* I'll explain mexico some other time, but the point is, I was still unsure if this was really what I wanted to do.
* I was terrified of the idea of sitting behind a desk ALL day
* Uncle Steven landed me a job just in time for me to ask Emily Watts out on a date

### Air Traffic Management

![](img/atm.png)

Note:
* Project: Provide up to date weather forecasts to optimize flight plans.
* Required some math and the basic understand of the physics of flight.

+++

### 787 Network Security

![](img/small-network-hub.png)

Note:
* Project: To monitor network traffic and detect anomalies.
* Based on Dendritic Cells and how they detect bad things in the body.
* We actually had a math guy that would write complex math and I would just implement it in code.

Note:
* Project: To simulate the KC46 Boeing Aerial Refueler for pilot training and flight test verification
* I admit, I didn't actually code on this project. I was just the project manager.
* Often times our job is to model real world things. *What do you think we were modeling on a project like this?*
* Lots of hardware and lots of math and modeling of physics required.

### Airplane Health Management

```js
let cpc_1 = data & 0b1000011
if (cpc_1 && preconditions) {
  if (hi_pressure === 1) {
    let reason_code = "10"
    send_report(reason_code)
  }
}
```

Note:
* Project: To predict failures in equipment to keep planes flying more often.
* Here's some code that shows kind of how it works.
* This project requires lots of working with Binary.
* *Does anyone know what Binary is?*
* *Does anyone know why Binary runs everything?*

### Software is Everywhere

* 🚀Aviation, 💪Biology, 🤖Robotics
* Diverse backgrounds in other sciences like Math and Physics are great 🔥

+++

### There's no One Way

* College
* Bootcamps
  * Galvanize
  * Praxis
* Self Taught

Note:
* If you want to get into this field
  * You can learn to code now.
  * You can always ask me questions.

### Theodore Roosevelt
> There are two kinds of success. One is the rare kind that comes to the person who has the power to do what no one else has the power to do. That is genius. But the average person who wins what we call success is not a genius. That person is a man or woman who has merely the ordinary qualities that they share with their fellows, but has developed those ordinary qualities to a more than ordinary degree.

Note:
* Whatever you end up doing, do it well, and you'll enjoy your work and be successful.
