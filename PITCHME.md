### First Exposure

![](img/warcraft-map-editor.png)

Note:
* I was 12 yrs old
* I didn't know I was doing programming, but I just loved creating things.

+++

### Education at a Glance

* Home-schooled, Private Schooled, Running Start
* Graduated with a 2 year Associates of Science Degree
* Pursued a BS in Computer Science and Systems
* 5 1/2 yrs, working 3 jobs and had 10K in debt

Note:
* 2 yr AS: I was planning to be an EE, but switched.
* 5 1/2 yrs: I doesn't normally take that long, but it will if you do smart things like fail an entire quarter.

+++

### An Unlikely Finish

* Graduated and proceed to...

Note:
* I'll explain mexico some other time, but the point is, I was still unsure if this was really what I wanted to do.
* I was terrified of the idea of sitting behind a desk ALL day
* Uncle Steven landed me a job just in time for me to ask Emily Watts out on a date

* I want to share a few projects with you to tell you what it's like doing my job.

### Air Traffic Management

![](img/atm.png)

Note:
* Project: Provide up to date weather forecasts to optimize flight plans.
* Required some math and the basic understand of the physics of flight.

+++

### 787 Network Security

![](img/small-network-hub.png)

Note:
* Project: To monitor network traffic and detect anomalies.
* Based on Dendritic Cells and how they detect bad things in the body.
* We actually had a math guy that would write complex math and I would just implement it in code.

Note:
* Project: To simulate the KC46 Boeing Aerial Refueler for pilot training and flight test verification
* I admit, I didn't actually code on this project. I was just the project manager.
* Often times our job is to model real world things. *What do you think we were modeling on a project like this?*
* Lots of hardware and lots of math and modeling of physics required.

### Airplane Health Management

```js
let cpc_1 = data & 0b1000011
if (cpc_1 && preconditions) {
  if (hi_pressure === 1) {
    let reason_code = "10"
    send_report(reason_code)
  }
}
```

Note:
* Project: To predict failures in equipment to keep planes flying more often.
* Here's some code that shows kind of how it works.
* This project requires lots of working with Binary.
* *Does anyone know what Binary is?*
* *Does anyone know why Binary runs everything?*

### Software is Everywhere

* 🚀Aviation, 💪Biology, 🤖Robotics
* Diverse backgrounds in other sciences like Math and Physics are great 🔥

+++

### There's no One Way

* College
* Bootcamps
  * Galvanize
  * Praxis
* Self Taught

Note:
* If you want to get into this field
  * You can learn to code now.
  * You can always ask me questions.
